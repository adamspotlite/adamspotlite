Hi, I’m [Adam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamsawicki1/) 🥦

I'm currently working on [Spotlite](https://spotlite.live/) to help event organizers reimagine their digital prescence :confetti_ball:

I'm former CTO + co-founder of [Lost Worlds](https://lostworlds.io/) and my own social impact consultancy 👨‍💻

I’m interested in technology, startups, and the future 🚀

Feel free to [email](mailto:adam@spotlite.live) or add some time on my [calendar](https://calendly.com/adamjsawicki/meeting) to talk!
